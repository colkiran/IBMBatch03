Packages and Modules
--------------------
Modules
-------
modules are same as libraries, any python file can be considered as a module. Python modules have the same extension of a python file.

Packages
--------
packages are folders / directories that stores one or more modules inside it.

import mymodule

1. mymodule.py => __pycache__ / mymodule.cpython_311.pyc

2. search for the modules in sys.path if modules exist then convert it into .pyc files and import it into your files


3. python compares the date and time of .py and .pyc files and expects .pyc file to have the latest date and time compared to .py file



import mymodule
import mymodule as m
import mypackage.mymodule as m

from mymodule import greet
from mymodule import Player

from mypackage import *	

packages are always compared with classes

classes  have a constructor  __init__.py

packages have a file __init__.py - that gets executed first
