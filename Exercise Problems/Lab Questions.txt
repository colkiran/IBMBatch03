Write python programs to carry out the following by reading the relevant data:

1.Calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
2.Convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula: F = (C * 9/5) + 32.
3.Calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula: A = π * r^2.
4.Compute the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem: c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2).
5.Calculate the simple interest on an investment using the formula: A = P * T * R / 100;
6.Calculate the compound interest on an investment using the formula: A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t).
7.Determine the volume of a sphere given its radius using the formula: V = (4/3) * π * r^3.
8.Convert a distance from kilometers to miles using the formula: miles = kilometers * 0.621371.
9.Calculate the sum of the first n natural numbers using the formula: sum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2.

10.Compute the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides using Heron's formula.

The formula is as follows:

s = (a + b + c) / 2
A = sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

where:

a, b, and c are the lengths of the triangle's sides.
s is the semiperimeter (half of the perimeter) of the triangle.
A is the area of the triangle.
